    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 overripe bananas</li>
        <li>1/3 cup melted butter</li>
        <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp nutmeg</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups flour</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.</li>
        <li>Grease an 8.5" x 4.5" loaf pan with butter, oil, or Pam spray.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the melted butter and sugar.</li>
        <li>Add the bananas. Mash them then mix into the butter and sugar 
            mixture.</li>
        <li>Add the egg and vanilla extract. Stir.</li>
        <li>Mix in the baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, and flour.</li>
        <li>Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan.</li>
        <li>Bake for about 40 minutes or until an inserted toothpick comes out 
            clean. <strong>OVEN TIMES VARY.</strong> Some people need 55 
            minutes. Others need 30 minutes. Please use your own judgment and 
            the toothpick trick (insert a wooden toothpick in the middle of 
            the bread. If it comes out clean, the bread is done. If it comes 
            out with batter on the toothpick, please continue baking. It is not 
            done). In a fairly new, convection oven, it takes around 40 minutes 
            for my bread to be done.</li>
        <li>Remove from oven and let cool. For clean slices, please allow the 
            bread to completely cool.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
