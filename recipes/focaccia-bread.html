    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups all purpose flour or bread flour</li>
        <li>2 tsp kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 tsp instant yeast</li>
        <li>2 cups lukewarm water</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>4 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>Flaky sea salt</li>
        <li>1 to 2 tsp whole rosepmary leaves (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, and instant 
            yeast. Once combined, add the water and form a sticky dough 
            ball.</li>
        <li>Rub the surface of the dough lightly with olive oil and cover 
            the bowl with a damp cloth.</li>
        <li>Immediately place the bowl in the fridge to set for between 12 
            hours and 3 days.</li>
        <li>Let your dough rise.</li>
        <li>Set a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat it to 425°F.</li>
        <li>Line a 9" x 13" pan with parchment paper or grease with 
            butter.</li>
        <li>Pour 2 tablespoons of oil in to the center of the pan.</li>
        <li>Using two forks, deflate the dough by releasing it from the sides 
            of the bowl and pulling it toward the center.</li>
        <li>Place the dough into the prepared pan. If using the rosemary, 
            sprinkle it over the dough.</li>
        <li>Pour 2 tablespoons of oil over your dough.</li>
        <li>Rub your hands lightly in the oil to coat, then, using all of your 
            fingers, press straight down to create deep dimples. If necessary, 
            gently stretch the dough as you dimple to allow the dough to fill 
            the pan.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle with flaky sea salt all over.</li>
        <li>Transfer the pan to the oven and bake for 25 to 30 minutes, until 
            the underside is golden and crisp.</li>
        <li>Remove the pan from the oven and transfer the focaccia to a 
            cooling rack. Let it cool for 10 minutes before cutting and 
            serving.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
